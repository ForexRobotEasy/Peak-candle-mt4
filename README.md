## Features

- Market trend and pattern analysis
- Price action and candlestick pattern analysis
- Trade entry and exit based on analysis
- Risk parameter adjustment
- Display of trade information
- News filter handling
- Performance optimization

## How it Works

The program starts by performing market analysis on multiple timeframes (M1, M5, and M15). It uses the `analyzeMarketTrends` function to identify support and resistance levels and display them on the chart.

Next, it analyzes price action and candlestick patterns using the `analyzePriceAction` function. It checks for bullish engulfing and bearish engulfing patterns in the previous and current bars of the M1 timeframe.

If a bullish engulfing pattern is detected, the program enters a long trade using the `enterTrade` function. If a bearish engulfing pattern is detected, the program enters a short trade. The trade size is determined by the `lotSize` variable, and the stop loss and take profit levels are set to `stopLoss` and `takeProfit` respectively.

The program also provides functions to exit a trade (`exitTrade`), adjust risk parameters (`adjustRiskParameters`), display trade information (`displayTradeInfo`), handle news filtering (`handleNewsFilter`), and optimize performance (`optimizePerformance`).
